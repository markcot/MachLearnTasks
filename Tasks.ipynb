    "Definition of **square root** of a number: A mathematical relationship to a given original number, insofar as when the square root number is multiplied by itself (otherwise known as the number squared), the multiplication result equals the original number [1, 2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of two has a mathematical property that it can not be written as a fraction, makes it an irrational number [3]. This also means that amount of decimal places for square root of 2 is infinite and has currently been calculated to 10 trillion digits [4, 5]. The square root of 2 to 100 decimal places is as follows [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{2} = 1.4142135623 7309504880 1688724209 6980785696 7187537694 8073176679 7379907324 7846210703 8850387534 3276415727... $$\n",

    "Computers can be used to calculate the approximate square root of a given number, where an initial guess for the square root is taken and a recursive algorithm is used to calculate a better estimate of the square root [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method is an algorithm that is often used to quickly calculate the square root of a number [8]. In computing, Newton's method does have problems insofar as a poor initial guess, oscillating successive estimations and rounding errors may cause the algorithm not to converge on the desired result or for two different computers to produce different results using the same algorithm [8, 9]. This algorithm estimates a better approximately of the square root of $q$ using the average of the initial guess $x_{0}$ and fraction of $q$ divided by $x_{0}$, with the reasoning that if $x_{0}$ then $\\frac{q}{x_{0}}$ would be too small. The equation for the first iteration of the Newton's algorithm to calculate the next better square root estimate $x_{1}$ is as follows [8]:\n",

    "\n",
    "Another less well known algorithm for calculating the square root of a number is the Bakhshali manuscript method [7, 10]. It is based on an ancient Indian mathematical manuscript. This algorithm also requires the use of an initial guess for the square root $x_{0}$ of a number $q$. To calculate the next better approximation of the square root $x$, a modifier value $a$ is calculated based the difference between $q$ and the square of previous square root estimate $x$. This method has been shown to be equivalent to two iterations of the Newton method [7, 10]. The equations for the first iteration of the Bakhshali algorithm to calculate the next better square root estimate $x_{1}$ is as follows [10]:\n",

    "### Steps and challenges to implementation the square root algorithm in Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a Python function called \"sqrt2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pick a reasonable initial estimate for the square root the required number, noting that the instructions specifically require square root of the number 2 be printed to the screen. My first chosen estimate setting $x_{0} = \\frac{1}{2} q$ resulted in a having a $0$ value of the Bakhshali method $a$ modifier for $\\sqrt{4}$. As such I decided to set $x_{0} = \\frac{2}{3} q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide on the precision required for the estimated square root, noting that the task instructions require $\\sqrt{2}$ be printed to 100 decimal places. The precision of the 100 decimal place calculation was not mentioned, but I have decided that a precision of greater than 100 decimal places is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide how to display the square root result to 100 decimal places. A formated string seemed the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a loop to iterate the equations a number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write equations to calculate a better approximation of the square root. After applying the Bakhshali method equation [10] the level of precision for the approximation of $\\sqrt{2}$ was achieved to 14 decimal places. However, after the third iteration, the calculations estimate of $\\sqrt{2}$ started oscillating continuously between two estimates. A quick check of the Newton method equation [8] showed that it reached a recurring estimate after the forth iteration and the level of precision for the approximation of $\\sqrt{2}$ was also achieved to 14 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Devise a method for storing the square root to 100 decimal places. I have noticed that the numbers are limited a maximum of 50 decimal places. This appears to be due to the 53 significant bit limit for a 64 bit binary number [11]. Without importing the Python decimal module, I am finding it difficult to store more than 53 significant bit, without importing the Python decimal module [12]\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limit the number of loop iterations to a sensible number say 100 to prevent the algorithm loop oscillating or diverging from the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Print calculation error message if this irritation limit is reached and revise the method for initial guess for the square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Test the function against known values/functions for square root.\n",
