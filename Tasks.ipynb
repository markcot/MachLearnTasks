    "##### Square root\n",
    "**Definition of square root of a number:** A mathematical relationship to a given original number, insofar as when the square root number is multiplied by itself (otherwise known as the number squared), the multiplication result equals the original number [1.1, 1.2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of two has a mathematical property that it can not be written as a fraction, makes it an irrational number [1.3]. This also means that amount of decimal places for square root of 2 is infinite and has currently been calculated to 10 trillion digits [1.4, 1.5]. The square root of 2 to 100 decimal places is as follows [1.6].\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{2} = 1.4142135623 7309504880 1688724209 6980785696 7187537694 8073176679 7379907324 7846210703 8850387534 3276415727... $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Computer calculation\n",
    "Computers can be used to calculate the approximate square root of a given number, where an initial guess for the square root is taken and a recursive algorithm is used to calculate a better estimate of the square root [1.7].\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Newton's method\n",
    "Newton's method is an algorithm that is often used to quickly calculate the square root of a number [1.8]. In computing, Newton's method does have problems insofar as a poor initial guess, oscillating successive estimations and rounding errors may cause the algorithm not to converge on the desired result or for two different computers to produce different results using the same algorithm [1.8, 1.9]. This algorithm progressively estimates a better approximately of the square root of $q$ using the average of the initial guess $x_{0}$ and fraction of $q$ divided by $x_{0}$, with the reasoning that if $x_{0}$ is too big then $\\frac{q}{x_{0}}$ would be too small. The equation for the first iteration of the Newton's algorithm to calculate the next better square root estimate $x_{1}$ is as follows [1.8]:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} (x_{0} + \\frac{q}{x_{0}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bakhshali manuscript method\n",
    "Another less well known algorithm for calculating the square root of a number is the Bakhshali manuscript method [1.7, 1.10]. It is based on an ancient Indian mathematical manuscript. This algorithm also requires the use of an initial guess for the square root $x_{0}$ of a number $q$. To calculate the next better approximation of the square root $x$, a modifier value $a$ is calculated based the difference between $q$ and the square of previous square root estimate $x$. This method has been shown to be equivalent to two iterations of the Newton method [1.7, 1.10]. The equations for the first iteration of the Bakhshali algorithm to calculate the next better square root estimate $x_{1}$ is as follows [1.10]:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_{0} = {\\frac{q - x^2_{0}}{2x_{0}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{1} = x_{0} + a_{0} - {\\frac{a^2_{0}} {2(x_{0} + a_{0})}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Digit-by-digit calculation method\n",
    "A different approach I decided to investigate, is the digit-by-digit calculation method [1.7, 1.13]. This method involves treating the square root number as a sum of each digit that make up the whole and and decimal part of the number. The algorithm to implement this method involves using only integer values. The thinking behind the method is that the square root of a number $q$ is made up of a series of numbers and often decimal numbers let's say a two digit number $ab$. The digit on the left of the square root is the largest digit so that $x^{2}$ is less than or equal to $q$. The remainder of $(q - x^{2})$ can be used to calculate the next largest digit $y$ so that $(10x + y)^{2}$ are the two next largest digit less than $q$ and so on for largest number or square roots that have decimal places. If the number are divided into pairs and as the calculation progresses to the right, the left part $p$ of the square root remains the same and only the right hand digits would have to calculated. This method can be incrementally calculates each square root digit that when placed in a line displays the value of the square root number required. For a base 10 decimal system, it is based on the following equation [1.7, 1.12].\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q = (10x+y)^{2} = 100x^{2} + 20xy + y^{2} = (10x) 2 + (20x + y ) y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Where a and b are two successive digits in of the square root result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a version Newton's method using integer division the largest next integer part of the square root can be calculated accurately without have to deal with floating point number approximations and rounding [1.13, 1.14]. This method can be used to accurately calculate a square root number to large number of decimal places.\n"

    "\n",
    "* Pick a reasonable initial estimate for the square root the required number. The task instructions require the function to printed to the screen $\\sqrt{2}$. My first chosen estimate setting $x_{0} = \\frac{1}{2} q$ resulted in a having a $0$ value for the Bakhshali method $a$ modifier for testing $\\sqrt{4}$. As such, I decided to set $x_{0} = \\frac{2}{3} q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a loop to iterate the equations a number of times. A while loop that ends when a reasonable precision is reached was chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limit the number of loop iterations to a sensible number say 10 to prevent the algorithm loop oscillating or diverging from the desired result creating an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide how to display the square root result to 100 decimal places. A formated string seems the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write equations to calculate a better approximation of the square root. After applying the Bakhshali method equation [1.10] the estimate of $\\sqrt{2}$ was achieved correct to 14 to 15 decimal places. However, after the third iteration, the calculations estimate of $\\sqrt{2}$ started oscillating continuously between two estimates. A check using the alternative Newton's method equation [8] showed that it also reached a recurring estimate after the forth iteration and the level of precision for the approximation of $\\sqrt{2}$ was also correct to 14 decimal places. The Bakhshali method appeared to achieve an accurate result for square root in slightly less iterations than the Newton's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Test the function against known values/functions for square root. During testing I used user input value version of the sqrt2() function to test two known square roots for two perfect square numbers [2]. For testing I used the Python numpy and math module functions both called sqrt() to check what precision they could achieve and both appear to calculate $\\sqrt{2}$ correct to 15 decimal places also.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Devise a method for storing the square root to 100 decimal places. The estimated approximations of $\\sqrt{2}$ are limited a maximum of 50 decimal places. This appears to be due to the 53 significant bit limit for a 64 bit binary number [1.11] for Python floating point numbers after which rounding/truncation occurs.\n",

    "Using Python, both the Bakhshali method and Newton's method can be used to calculate the $\\sqrt{2}$ using floating point number correct to approximately 14 decimal places. Similarly Python numpy and math module functions both called sqrt() can only calculate $\\sqrt{2}$ to 15 decimal places. A larger binary bit would be required to calculate a more accurate estimate of $\\sqrt{2}$ using computers.\n",
