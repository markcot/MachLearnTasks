    "##### Square root\n",
    "**Definition of square root of a number:** A mathematical relationship to a given original number, insofar as when the square root number is multiplied by itself (otherwise known as the number squared), the multiplication result equals the value of the original number [1.1, 1.2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of two has a mathematical property that it cannot be written as a fraction, making it an irrational number [1.3]. This also means that the amount of decimal places for square root of 2 is infinite and has currently been calculated to 10 trillion digits [1.4, 1.5]. The square root of 2 to 100 decimal places is as follows [1.6].\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{2} = 1.4142135623 7309504880 1688724209 6980785696 7187537694 8073176679 7379907324 7846210703 8850387534 3276415727... $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Computer calculation\n",
    "Computers can be used to calculate the approximate square root of a given number, where an initial guess for the square root is taken and a recursive algorithm is used to calculate a better estimate of the square root [1.7].\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Newton's method\n",
    "Newton's method is an algorithm that is often used to quickly calculate the square root of a number [1.8]. In computing, Newton's method does have problems insofar as a poor initial guess, oscillating successive estimations and rounding errors may cause the algorithm not to converge on the desired result or for two different computers to produce different results using the same algorithm [1.8, 1.9]. This algorithm progressively estimates a better approximately of the square root of $q$ using the average of the initial guess $x_{0}$ and fraction of $q$ divided by $x_{0}$, with the reasoning that if $x_{0}$ is too big then $\\frac{q}{x_{0}}$ would be too small. The equation for the first iteration of the Newton's algorithm to calculate the next better square root estimate $x_{1}$ is as follows [1.8]:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} (x_{0} + \\frac{q}{x_{0}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bakhshali manuscript method\n",
    "Another less well known algorithm for calculating the square root of a number is the Bakhshali manuscript method [1.7, 1.10]. It is based on an ancient Indian mathematical manuscript. This algorithm also requires the use of an initial guess for the square root $x_{0}$ of a number $q$. To calculate the next better approximation of the square root $x$, a modifier value $a$ is calculated based the difference between $q$ and the square of previous square root estimate $x$. This method has been shown to be equivalent to two iterations of the Newton method [1.7, 1.10]. The equations for the first iteration of the Bakhshali algorithm to calculate the next better square root estimate $x_{1}$ is as follows [1.10]:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_{0} = {\\frac{q - x^2_{0}}{2x_{0}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{1} = x_{0} + a_{0} - {\\frac{a^2_{0}} {2(x_{0} + a_{0})}}$$\n",

    "##### Digit-by-digit calculation method\n",
    "A different approach I investigated, is the digit-by-digit calculation method [1.7, 1.13]. This method involves treating the square root number as a sum of each digit position that make up the whole and decimal parts of the square root number. The algorithm to implement this method involves using only integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thinking behind the method is that the square root of a number $q$ is made up of a series of numbers, let's say a two digit number $xy$. The left digit of the square root is the largest digit so that $x^{2} \\leq q$. The remainder $r$ can be used to calculate the next largest digit $y$ so that $(10x + y)^{2} \\leq q$, where $x$ and $y$ are the two largest digits in the sequence of $\\sqrt{q}$. This can be repeated for square root numbers with more digits or decimal places. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the numbers are divided into pairs the largest square root of a pair of number is a single digit [1.16]. As the calculation progresses to the right, the remainder $r$ is passed right and the left part $p$ of the square root remains the same. As such only the further digits to the right would have to be calculated. The part $p$ of the square root that is already calculated is scaled up by a factor of 10 after each iteration during the calculation, thereby maintaining $p$ as an integer and avoiding float point approximations. This method can be used to incrementally calculate each square root digit. When displays in a line each digit of $p$ show the value of the square root number required. The method is based on the following expansion of equation above [1.7, 1.12].\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q = (10x + y)^{2} = 100x^{2} + 20xy + y^{2} = (10x)^{2} + (20x + y)y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where x and y are two successive digits in the sequence of the square root result.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are looking for the next digit in the calculation $y$, we know that the part of the square root already calculated for the digit shifted to the left $10x$ is squared and subtracted from the $q$, it gives us a current value $c$ to calculate the next digit value $y$, such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(20x + y)y \\leq c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(20x + y)y \\leq c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x$ is the part of the know part $p$ of the square before it was factored up by 10, so this equation can be rewriting as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(20p + y)y \\leq c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder $r$ can be calculated the using the formula $(20p + y)y + r = c$ or $r = c - (20p + y)y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a version Newton's method using integer division the largest next integer part of the square root can be calculated accurately without have to deal with floating point number approximations and rounding [1.13, 1.14]."

My first chosen estimate setting $x_{0} = \\frac{1}{2} q$ resulted in a having a $0$ value for the Bakhshali method $a$ modifier for testing $\\sqrt{4}$. As such, I decided to set $x_{0} = \\frac{2}{3} q$.\n",

    "* Write equations to calculate a better approximation of the square root. After applying the Bakhshali method equation [1.10] the estimate of $\\sqrt{2}$ was achieved correct to 14 to 15 decimal places. However, after the third iteration, the calculations estimate of $\\sqrt{2}$ started oscillating continuously between two estimates. A check using the alternative Newton's method equation [8] showed that it also reached a recurring estimate after the forth iteration and the level of precision for the approximation of $\\sqrt{2}$ was also correct to 14 decimal places. The Bakhshali method appeared to achieve an accurate result for square root in slightly less iterations than the Newton's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Test the function against known values/functions for square root. During testing I used user input value version of the sqrt2() function to test two known square roots for two perfect square numbers [2]. For testing I used the Python numpy and math module functions both called sqrt() to check what precision they could achieve and both appear to calculate $\\sqrt{2}$ correct to 15 decimal places also.\n",

    "Using Python, both the Bakhshali method and Newton's method can be used to calculate the $\\sqrt{2}$ using floating point number correct to approximately 14 decimal places. Similarly Python numpy and math module functions both called sqrt() can only calculate $\\sqrt{2}$ to 15 decimal places. A larger binary bit would be required to calculate a more accurate estimate of $\\sqrt{2}$ using computers.\n",
